### Eelectric Vehicle Charging Demand Estimator
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Folium, Kepler.gl, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit

**Skills Demonstrated:** Geospatial data aggregation & visualization, supervised machine learning (classification & regression), data cleaning & preprocessing, feature engineering from temporal and spatial EV data, interactive app development with Streamlit, model evaluation and metric interpretation.

<div class="justify-text">
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
  The EV Charging Demand Estimator is a data-driven tool designed to help policymakers and energy providers identify underserved areas for EV infrastructure expansion. Using publicly available EV population data, the project estimates where public charging stations are most needed across regions by analyzing EV density, vehicle type, and location-based demand signals.

  Two models were developed:
	<li>Classification model to label high/medium/low demand regions.</li>
	<li>Regression model to predict the expected number of EVs per region.</li>

Visual insights and model outputs were deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit app.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Counties with high EV population growth often lack proportional charging infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Urban regions showed non-linear demand trends due to saturation and availability of home chargers.</li>
    <li>Certain suburban and rural counties were flagged as high-opportunity zones for new charging stations.</li>
  </ul>

### Macroeconomic Forecasting with VAR Models in R

**Tools:** R, vars, urca, dplyr, ggplot2  
**Skills Demonstrated:** Time series stationarity analysis, ARIMA modeling, VAR modeling, cointegration testing, impulse response analysis, forecast error variance decomposition, data visualization

<div class="justify-text">
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
  This project applies time series forecasting techniques in R to analyze and predict movements in four key macroeconomic indicators: the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), PPI for Finished Goods (PPIFG), and PPI for Finished Consumer Foods (PPIFCF). The analysis involved testing for stationarity and cointegration, fitting ARIMA and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models, and evaluating model performance using forecast error metrics (MSE, MAE). Impulse response functions and forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) were used to analyze interdependencies and the effects of shocks on each series.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>All four series were found to be integrated of order one (I(1)), requiring first differencing for stationarity.</li>
    <li>Optimal lag lengths for VAR models were determined using AIC, with VAR(6) providing the best forecasting performance overall.</li>
    <li>Impulse response analysis showed CPI was significantly influenced by lagged values of PPI and PPIFG, while PPI responded to shocks in CPI and PPIFG with lagged, oscillating behavior.</li>
    <li>FEVD analysis confirmed CPI‚Äôs dominance in explaining its own forecast variance and PPI‚Äôs high sensitivity to CPI innovations.</li>
