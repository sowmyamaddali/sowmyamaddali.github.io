## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.6;">
I’m a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. My experience spans building <strong>scalable machine learning pipelines</strong>, working with <strong>big data tools like PySpark</strong>, and deploying models in <strong>AWS cloud environments</strong>. I thrive at the intersection of <strong>engineering and analytics</strong>, blending hands-on technical skills with a strong sense of business impact. Whether it’s <strong>optimizing infrastructure costs</strong>, <strong>accelerating ML workflows</strong>, or crafting <strong>interactive visualizations</strong> for stakeholders, I bring both precision and creativity to the table. Outside of work, I enjoy <strong>gaming, reading, and creative writing</strong>. These hobbies keep me curious, help me recharge, and inspire new approaches to learning and problem-solving.
