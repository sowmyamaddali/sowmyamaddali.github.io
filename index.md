## About Me
<div class="justify-text">
I’m a Data Scientist with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. My experience spans building scalable machine learning pipelines, working with big data tools like PySpark, and deploying models in AWS cloud environments. I thrive at the intersection of engineering and analytics, blending hands-on technical skills with a strong sense of business impact. Whether it’s optimizing infrastructure costs, accelerating ML workflows, or crafting interactive visualizations for stakeholders, I bring both precision and creativity to the table. Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, reading, and creative writing. These hobbies keep me curious, help me recharge, and inspire new approaches to learning and problem-solving.
